# Krmx State
TypeSafe State and Action Management Solution for Krmx.

> If you've used Krmx before you know it can be tedious to manually sync state on server and client-side. To circumvent these issues, this mono repo sets up a [Krmx](https://simonkarman.github.io/krmx) server and client using a **KrmxState** architecture.

## Getting started
First run `npm install` in the root of this repository.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start the state, server and client in development mode.
